Natural Languague Processing:
Using computers to text data. NLP falls under AI, which is a filed that tries to replicate what humans can do using computers.

AI:
1) Computer Vision: Seeing like a human.
    - Image recognition.
    - Object detection.
2) Machine Learning: Learning like a human.
    - Supervised learning.
    - Unsupervised learning.
3) NLP: Interpreting language like a human.
    - Sentiment analysis.
    - Text summarization.

Traditional NLP:
    - Rules-Based. Application: Sentiment Analysis.
    - Supervised Learning (Naive Bayes).  Application: Text Classification.
    - Unsupervised Learning (NMF).  Application: Topic Modeling.
Modern NLP:
    - Encoder-Only LLM (BERT).  Application: Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Encoder-Decoder LLM (BART).  Application: Zero Shot Classification, Text Summarization.
    - Decoder-Only LLM (GPT).  Application: Text Generation.
    - Embeddings (MiniLM).  Application: Document Similarity.

NLP Libraries in Python:
Text Preprocessing:
    - Pandas: Cleaning & Normalization.
    - SpaCy: Cleaning & Normalization, Linguistic Analysis.
    - Scikit-learn: Vectorization.
NLP with Machine Learning:
